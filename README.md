# Skill Issue

How to actually route requests from a hybrid app like remix to a lambda function like wing api (a cloud-native version of express) in a serverless manner? Could it be similar to deploying on vercel with the api folder? May need to copy SST's notes. Skill issue.

If I were to pack an entire website into a Lambda function and serve it that way upon request, rather than serve it as a static website in a bucket, how would I go about doing that? And this is really specific to something like Remix Run, which is a React hybrid server-side rendered and single-page app similar to Next.js. And it could be an overlapping strategy with SST that does something very similar. Do you have any ideas where I might start there?

To pack an entire website into an AWS Lambda function and serve it upon request, especially a React-based site using a framework like Remix Run, you would need to follow these general steps:

Prepare Your Remix Run Application:

Build your Remix Run application as you normally would for server-side rendering (SSR).
Ensure your build output includes both the server-side and client-side assets.
Lambda Function:

Create a Lambda function that will handle requests and return the appropriate responses. You can use a Node.js environment because Remix and Next.js like frameworks are Node.js based.
Your Lambda handler will need to import the server build of your Remix application and use it to handle the incoming HTTP requests.
Remember that Lambda has a read-only filesystem except for /tmp, and there are also limits to the size of your package. So, it's essential to ensure your application is bundled efficiently.
API Gateway:

Set up an API Gateway to trigger your Lambda function. This will act as the entry point for your web application.
Configure the API Gateway to handle different HTTP methods and resources, essentially proxying requests to your Lambda function.
Lambda@Edge (Optional):

To improve latency and reduce the load on your Lambda function, consider using Lambda@Edge to cache static assets at the edge locations.
Serverless Framework or AWS SAM:

To simplify the deployment process, you can use the Serverless Framework or AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) which can help in defining resources like Lambda functions and API Gateway through simple configuration files.
Serverless Stack (SST):

If you're considering using SST, it provides a higher-level framework that integrates with AWS CDK. It simplifies the deployment and local development of serverless applications.
SST includes features like live Lambda development, which could be particularly useful for building SSR applications.
Deployment:

Deploy your infrastructure using your chosen tool (Serverless, SAM, SST).
Once deployed, your API Gateway would serve as the URL for your web application.
Testing:

Test your application thoroughly. Pay special attention to cold start times and performance, as these can be issues with server-side rendering on Lambda.
For specific guides or tutorials, you might want to search for articles or resources that detail deploying Remix Run on AWS Lambda, as the specifics can get quite complex. Due to the size constraints and the nature of Lambda's ephemeral environment, there might be some trial and error to get everything working smoothly.

Would you like me to find some resources or tutorials that can guide you through this process?

I found several resources that can help you get started with deploying a Remix Run app on AWS Lambda:

Stack Overflow Discussion:

There's a discussion on Stack Overflow regarding deploying a Remix app to AWS Lambda, mentioning specific configurations with @remix-run/architect and issues related to esbuild and aws-sdk dependencies​​. [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75871564/deploying-remix-app-to-lambda-function-in-aws)

DEV Community Tutorial:

A comprehensive guide on building a serverless Remix app with a contact form using AWS Lambda, AWS SES for email, and Google ReCaptcha for spam protection is available on DEV Community. The guide goes through setting up the Remix app with the necessary AWS integrations​​.

Official Remix Resources:

The Remix Run website provides resources for deploying using various stacks and might have specific instructions for AWS Lambda​​. [Grunge Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9sHle5Q8ME#:~:text=,run%2Fstacks)

This Dot Labs Guide:

This Dot Labs offers a guide on deploying Remix with Architect, recommending the Grunge Stack. It provides a step-by-step approach starting with creating a new Remix project using the Grunge Stack template​​. [thisdot.co remix deploy arch](https://www.thisdot.co/blog/remix-deployment-with-architecture)

SST Documentation:

The SST (Serverless Stack Toolkit) documentation includes a section on the RemixSite construct, which is a higher-level CDK construct designed to make it easy to create and deploy a Remix app to AWS. It details how static assets are served from an S3 Bucket and CloudFront CDN, while the app server is deployed to Lambda​​. [sst remix](https://docs.sst.dev/constructs/RemixSite)

Remix Team (RPF and Michael Jackson) discuss some of these things in their Roadmap Planning session here [remix roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8eb83XDFNg)

You can explore these resources for detailed instructions and consider the specific requirements and limitations of your application when deciding on the deployment strategy. Would you like to start with any particular guide?
